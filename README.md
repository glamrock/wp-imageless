wp-imageless
============

Strip wordpress image tags from posts and comments, but not the theme. *Crazy* useful for people running wordpress blogs as Tor hidden services. Cuts down on load time, bandwidth, and hassle.

*NOTE:* images aren't removed, they're just not displayed.

##Use
* **wp-imageless** disables images from posts, comments, and RSS feeds. (Excluding theme images).
* **medialess** disables media and images, except audio and theme images.
* **soundless** disables the HTML5 <audio></audio> tags only.

Upload to wp-content/plugins/, then activate in the admin menu. If you hate it, just deactivate it.
